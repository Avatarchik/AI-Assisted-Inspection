# AI-Assisted-Inspection

## *Introduction:*
A smart visual inspection assistance device will be developed by integrating AI automation and computer vision technologies into a customized mixed reality headset. With the help of this wearable device, inspectors will be able to perform fast, accurate, and quantified assessment of civil infrastructures. The AI system integrated in this innovation will continuously assist the inspectors during their routine and in-depth visual inspections, by displaying real-time damage information in front of their eyes, such as crack width, length, count, delamination area, rusting, etc.  The inspection data will be later exported to a compatible format for AASHTOWARE, thereby reducing time needed for reporting. Besides automatic detection of defects, the device will also be capable of helping inspectors access hard to reach locations by either magnifying the view of a far location, or, alternatively, by connecting to an unmanned aerial system. Furthermore, if the inspector needs assistance from the central office, the remote expert connection will share the inspectorâ€™s view with the central office.
